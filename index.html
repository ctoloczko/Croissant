    <h1>Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, and crescent-shaped pastry originating
      from France, known for its layered texture and rich flavor. It is made
      from a laminated dough, which involves folding butter into the dough
      multiple times to create thin layers of dough separated by butter. When
      baked, the water in the butter evaporates, causing the dough to puff up
      and create the croissant's characteristic flaky layers.

    <h3>Fun fact</h3>
    <p>
      Despite their strong association with France, croissants are believed to
      have been inspired by the Austrian kipferl, a crescent-shaped pastry. They
      became popular in France after being introduced by Austrian bakers in the
      19th century.
